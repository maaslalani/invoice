Installing on Linux:

There are many different Linux distributions and some handle font management
differently. These instructions are for the most common Linux distributions:

1. Create a folder called ".fonts" in your home directory.
   Example: mkdir -p ~/.fonts

2. Copy the otf files in the "Inter Desktop" folder into your .fonts directory
   Example: cp "Inter Desktop"/*.otf ~/.fonts/

You may have to restart apps and/or your window server session.

Again, these instructions are for the most common Linux distributuons like
Ubuntu and might not apply to you. Refer to the documentation for your
distribution for more details on how to manage fonts in your OS.


Q&A

Q: I installed the fonts but they don't show up
A: Try rebuilding the font database:
   sudo fc-cache -f -v
   Then restart your program(s).

Q: Is there a way to tell if Inter was actually installed?
A: Try running: fc-list | grep "Inter"

Q: ~/.fonts is an old thing. The new thing is ~/.local/share/fonts
A: Yes, that is true for recent distributions. These distros usually support
   ~/.fonts as well making these instructions work for everyone. Yay.
